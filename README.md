# Wimtorq
a WordPress plugin called Wimtorq. The plug-in should add an admin menu to the WordPress dashboard called Wimtorq. The menu option once clicked should redirect to a landing page with two input text fields. The text input will take and save the Stripe Api client secret and client id into the database as string variables and can be retrieved using Wordpress get_option(). The client id and secret will also be preloaded into the text fields from the database on page reload. Create a shortcode called [wimtorq-stripe], where ever this shortcode is used, a &lt;table> will be rendered using jQuery datatable(https://datatables.net/examples/data_sources/ajax) and an ajax request would be made backend to retrive and render the price name and amount Using the https://github.com/stripe/stripe-php composer package, all prices belonging to the stripe account which owns the stripe api client and secret will be retrieved and returned as a JSON response to the ajax request on step 5 containing the price name and amount. The datatable in step 5 should easily be paginated and the code to this plugin should be hosted on a public git repository and shared with us.
